# Dashboard Project

## Overview
This project is a dashboard application developed during Semester 2 at Humber College. The application integrates the QuickChart API to display a temperature line chart with custom point images. It was created as part of our coursework to apply our skills in React.js, UI/UX design, and API integration.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**: The primary JavaScript library used to build the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilized for styling and responsive design.
- **QuickChart API**: Used to generate the temperature line chart with custom point images.

# API's and Technologies Used
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where data changes over time.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs without leaving your HTML.
- **QuickChart API**: A free and open-source API used to generate charts, such as line charts, bar charts, and pie charts, dynamically. In this project, it's used to create a temperature line chart with custom point images.
